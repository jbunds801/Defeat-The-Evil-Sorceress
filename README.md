This project was centered around building a dynamic, turn based CLI program using OOP principles. You will be asked to choose from a variety of characters and give them a name, and then face off with the Evil Sorceress, Queen Bavmorda. It implements an attack, a special ability, a cost to use the special ability to prevent spamming it, a heal ability that has a 5 turn cooldown, and a block ability. All of the characters have different levels of strength and special ability power. The Queen regenerates health each turn as per the assignment requirments, with her own special ability, which fires at random. All of the players, the Sorceress included, have a randomized attack amount for both attack and the special ability, with the block being a percentage of that hit. 
Print messages were formatted for a better visual experience and for easy follow along.

Try your luck! You will be asked at the end if you want to try again! Download or copy and paste into in a code editor and run the file. Follow along and enjoy!
